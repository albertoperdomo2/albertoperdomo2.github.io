									Well, hello there! My name is Alberto Perdomo, but you can call me just Alberto. I'm a jack-of-all-trades with great passion for technology. With a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Automation Engineering from [ULPGC](https://www.ulpgc.es/), and a Master's degree in Biomedical and Biomechanical Engineering from [Vilnius Tech](https://vilniustech.lt/), I'm basically a walking, talking, engineering machine. Throughout my academic and professional career, I've developed a strong passion for machine learning, systems, Linux, infrastructure and devops practices.

									Even though I've been working as a software engineer for a few years now, I'm not your average desk jockey. No, sir. I've been a research assistant at VGTU, DevOps engineer in various companies, and now I'm Infrastructure engineer in the Deep Learning team at Crisalix Labs, where I get to work with an amazing group of people. 
									But don't let my chill vibes fool you, I'm a serious problem solver when it comes to engineering, particularly software. I love nothing more than tackling a difficult problem and figuring out the solution.

									It's not all about work for me and when I'm not tinkering away at some new project, I'm busy traveling around, hitting the gym or doing a few laps in the pool.

									When it comes to research, my focus has been on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and CV systems for telerehabilitation. I've got a particular interest in the intersection of technology and healthcare, and I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to make a positive impact on the world.

									Now, you might be thinking, "wow, this guy sounds like a real workhorse." And you're not wrong! I'm highly motivated, analytical, and goal-driven. However, I'm not all work and no play. I'm a team player at heart, and I love collaborating with others to achieve a common goal. Plus, I've got some pretty sweet communication and leadership skills to boot that I have been lucky enough to hone over the years. 

									So, if you're looking for a multi-talented, hard-working, and all-around awesome engineer, look no further! Please, keep in mind that at this moment in time **I'm not looking for full-time roles** but I'm always up for a new challenge and excited to continue growing and learning in my career.

									P.S. This site ain't no fancy schmancy flashy thing. Keep in mind that it's based on plain HTML+CSS, so don't go expecting any bells and whistles. But hey, the real gem here is the content. So stick around and give it a read, yeah?

									# Experience
									#### **Deep Learning Infrastructure Engineer**
									##### Crisalix Labs (Jun 2022 - Present)
									---
									My work includes but is not limited to designing and implementing the Deep Learning infrastructure (cloud and on-prem) required for the development and deployment of cutting-edge computer vision and DL models. This involves optimizing the training pipeline, managing data storage and processing systems, as well as designing and maintaining the computing infrastructure.

									#### **External consultant**
									##### EAE (May 2022 - Present)
									---
									As an external consultant for EAE Business School, I teach the subject of Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. In this role, I design and deliver course content, develop assignments and assessments, and provide feedback to students. Students are provided with a comprehensive introduction to statistical methods, data visualization, and machine learning among others.

									#### **DevOps Engineer**
									##### DataDope (May 2021 - Jun 2022)
									---
									My work involved utilizing various technologies such as Elasticsearch (ELK stack), Python, Ansible, and other automation and CI/CD tools to create and contribute to the main product. In addition, I developed end-to-end Machine Learning, monitoring, and observability solutions using the best open-source technologies available. My role also included undertaking internal research projects.

									#### **Research Assistant**
									##### Vilnius Tech (Jun 2021 - Oct 2021)
									---
									During my period of employment as a Research Assistant in the Faculty of Mechanics, Department of Biomedical Engineering at VGTU, I contributed to a Lithuania government project focused on the development of a Computer Vision system for telerehabilitation. My work involved utilizing different frameworks and hardware configurations, such as the Intel RealSense, NuiTrack, and MediaPipe, among others, and develop the first version of an autonomous telerehabilitation system which allowed access to healthcare to individuals in isolated areas.

									#### **DevOps Engineer**
									##### Videntifier Technolgies (Mar 2020 - May 2021)
									---
									During my time there, I was tasked with various responsibilities, including but not limited to system administration, infrastructure management, development of new internal functionalities, research, testing, and other related duties. I started as an intern for a couple of months and then promoted to full-time engineer. During the course of this internship, I gained valuable knowledge in various areas, including but not limited to monitoring tools, software usage, system administration, database administration, cloud administration, and development best practices and guidelines.
